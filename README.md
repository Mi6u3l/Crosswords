# TIDAL

## Ran with node version: v15.9.0

## Technology

* React/Redux
* Webpack
* Jest
* Sass

## Usage

* `npm start` to run the app at localhost:8080.
* `npm run test` to run a simple render test for ArtistSearch

## Also deployed here
https://confident-shaw-a41d78.netlify.app/

## Used the following chrome extension to bypass CORS:
`Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

## Things that could be improved with more time :)

* Better CSS alignment
* Maybe use Style Components
* Add more unit tests
* Migrate to TypeScript
* Use Sagas rather than Thunk
* Add one more reducer to control page loading
